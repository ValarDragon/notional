## Snapshots

On many networks you'll need to use ipfs to get genesis state.  Actual CID's coming soon!

| Network      | Archive | Pruned
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | 
| Regen      | cid | cid |
| Osmosis   | cid   | cid |
| Gaia      | cid | cid |
| Akash     | cid  | cid |
| Sentinel  | cid   |   cid    |
| Sifchain   | cid   | cid  |
| Starname   | cid  | cid |
| Iris       | cid   | cid  |
| Crypto.org | cid   | cid  |
| Persistence| cid | cid |

We distribute two snapshots for cosmos-sdk chains:

* pruning=nothing
* pruning=default



More detailed documentation is coming.  We are still getting the snapshots to work correctly, but you may now join the cluster and provide storage to it.  If you do so, please drop an issue here!
