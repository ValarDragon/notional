## The role of a validator

We think that validators should be actively involved in supporting the communities that they serve.  As we scaled, it became increasingly obvious to Jacob that he could not personally manage every piece of adequately serving all 18 IBCGang blockchain communities.  


Notional is validating, but not in the active set:
* Umee

Notional wishes to validate:
* Every IBC-enabled blockchain


Notional has decided to maintain relayers for all chains -- and [document processes](./relaying-guide) -- on all chains where we are in the active validator set.  Presently, that means that we will maintain relayers on 50 channels.  If you are a community member or team that wants to see notional relay for your community, please put an issue on this repository and we will set up a relayer.
